# Open Pincery — Experiment Log

## EXPAND — 2026-04-18T00:00Z

- **Gate**: PASS (attempt 1)
- **Evidence**: scope.md created with 10 acceptance criteria (AC-1 through AC-10), Skyscraper tier, self_host_individual deploy target, Rust+Postgres stack per preferences.md. All 12 gate conditions verified.
- **Changes**: Created `scaffolding/scope.md`
- **Retries**: 0
- **Next**: DESIGN

## DESIGN — 2026-04-18T00:01Z

- **Gate**: PASS (attempt 1)
- **Evidence**: design.md created with architecture diagram, directory structure (30+ files), interfaces for Agent/Event/Prompt/LLM/Tool/API, external integrations with error handling and test strategies, observability section, complexity exceptions. Key scenario traced end-to-end.
- **Changes**: Created `scaffolding/design.md`
- **Retries**: 0
- **Next**: ANALYZE

## ANALYZE — 2026-04-18T00:02Z

- **Gate**: PASS (attempt 1)
- **Evidence**: readiness.md created with Verdict=READY. All 10 ACs mapped to design components, tests, and runtime proofs. 12 truths, 6 scope-reduction risks, 3 bounded clarifications, 10-slice build order, 3 complexity exceptions.
- **Changes**: Created `scaffolding/readiness.md`
- **Retries**: 0
- **Next**: BUILD

## BUILD — 2026-04-18T00:03Z

- **Gate**: PASS (attempt 1)
- **Evidence**: 
  - Code compiles with 0 errors, 0 warnings
  - 15 integration tests pass across 10 test files (serial execution)
  - All 10 ACs have corresponding tests:
    - AC-1: lifecycle_test (CAS lifecycle happy path + invalid transitions)
    - AC-2: event_log_test (append and query)
    - AC-3: prompt_test (prompt assembly)
    - AC-4: wake_loop_test (sleep termination + iteration cap, using wiremock)
    - AC-5: maintenance_test (projection creation from mocked LLM)
    - AC-6: api_test (CRUD agents + auth enforcement)
    - AC-7: trigger_test (LISTEN/NOTIFY)
    - AC-8: stale_test (stale agent detection and recovery)
    - AC-9: drain_test (reacquire on pending events + release when empty)
    - AC-10: bootstrap_test (bootstrap flow + wrong token rejection)
  - Cargo.lock present
  - No hardcoded secrets in source
  - cargo-audit: unable to install (timeout), deferred
  - Schema fixes applied: llm_calls (purpose→call_type), projection work_list (JSONB→TEXT)
- **Changes**: All source modules, migrations, tests created. 5 commits.
- **Retries**: 0
- **Next**: REVIEW
