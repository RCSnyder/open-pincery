# Open Pincery — Experiment Log

## EXPAND — 2026-04-18T00:00Z

- **Gate**: PASS (attempt 1)
- **Evidence**: scope.md created with 10 acceptance criteria (AC-1 through AC-10), Skyscraper tier, self_host_individual deploy target, Rust+Postgres stack per preferences.md. All 12 gate conditions verified.
- **Changes**: Created `scaffolding/scope.md`
- **Retries**: 0
- **Next**: DESIGN

## DESIGN — 2026-04-18T00:01Z

- **Gate**: PASS (attempt 1)
- **Evidence**: design.md created with architecture diagram, directory structure (30+ files), interfaces for Agent/Event/Prompt/LLM/Tool/API, external integrations with error handling and test strategies, observability section, complexity exceptions. Key scenario traced end-to-end.
- **Changes**: Created `scaffolding/design.md`
- **Retries**: 0
- **Next**: ANALYZE

## ANALYZE — 2026-04-18T00:02Z

- **Gate**: PASS (attempt 1)
- **Evidence**: readiness.md created with Verdict=READY. All 10 ACs mapped to design components, tests, and runtime proofs. 12 truths, 6 scope-reduction risks, 3 bounded clarifications, 10-slice build order, 3 complexity exceptions.
- **Changes**: Created `scaffolding/readiness.md`
- **Retries**: 0
- **Next**: BUILD

## BUILD — 2026-04-18T00:03Z

- **Gate**: PASS (attempt 1)
- **Evidence**: 
  - Code compiles with 0 errors, 0 warnings
  - 15 integration tests pass across 10 test files (serial execution)
  - All 10 ACs have corresponding tests:
    - AC-1: lifecycle_test (CAS lifecycle happy path + invalid transitions)
    - AC-2: event_log_test (append and query)
    - AC-3: prompt_test (prompt assembly)
    - AC-4: wake_loop_test (sleep termination + iteration cap, using wiremock)
    - AC-5: maintenance_test (projection creation from mocked LLM)
    - AC-6: api_test (CRUD agents + auth enforcement)
    - AC-7: trigger_test (LISTEN/NOTIFY)
    - AC-8: stale_test (stale agent detection and recovery)
    - AC-9: drain_test (reacquire on pending events + release when empty)
    - AC-10: bootstrap_test (bootstrap flow + wrong token rejection)
  - Cargo.lock present
  - No hardcoded secrets in source
  - cargo-audit: unable to install (timeout), deferred
  - Schema fixes applied: llm_calls (purpose→call_type), projection work_list (JSONB→TEXT)
- **Changes**: All source modules, migrations, tests created. 5 commits.
- **Retries**: 0
- **Next**: REVIEW

## REVIEW — 2026-04-18T00:04Z

- **Gate**: PASS (attempt 1)
- **Evidence**: Review identified 2 critical and 6 required findings. All addressed in commit 82f7935. No `Critical` or `Required` findings remain.
- **Changes**: Code fixes applied per review findings (commit `fix(build): address REVIEW findings`)
- **Retries**: 0
- **Next**: RECONCILE

## RECONCILE — 2026-04-18T00:05Z

- **Structural drift fixed**:
  - design.md directory structure: tests were under `tests/integration/` in doc but `tests/` in code; added missing `src/lib.rs` and `src/auth.rs`
  - design.md interfaces: Agent struct missing `disabled_reason`/`disabled_at` fields; Event.source was `Option<String>` but code uses `String`; ChatRequest had `temperature` field not in code; ChatResponse.usage was non-optional but code uses `Option<Usage>`; LlmClient missing `maintenance_model` field; AgentStatus enum described but not implemented (code uses raw strings); `append_event` used `NewEvent` struct in doc but code uses individual params; `has_pending_events` query filter differed; `ToolCall` type renamed to `ToolCallRequest` in code
  - readiness.md Key Links: all 10 paths referenced `tests/integration/` but actual paths are `tests/`
  - log.md: missing REVIEW phase entry despite git commit 82f7935 recording review fixes
- **Documents updated**: `scaffolding/design.md`, `scaffolding/readiness.md`, `scaffolding/log.md`

## VERIFY — 2026-04-18T00:06Z

- **Gate**: PASS (attempt 1)
- **Evidence**: 17/17 tests pass. All 10 ACs verified with real evidence. All 12 truths confirmed by code inspection. No secrets in source. Deployment config exists (docker-compose.yml, .env.example). Application compiles cleanly (0 errors, 0 warnings).
- **Changes**: None (read-only verification)
- **Retries**: 0
- **Next**: DEPLOY

## DEPLOY — 2026-04-18T00:07Z

- **Gate**: PASS (attempt 1)
- **Evidence**: Application starts successfully, health endpoint returns 200 `{"status":"ok"}`, bootstrap creates admin + returns session token, double-bootstrap returns 409, auth rejects invalid tokens. docker-compose.yml + .env.example present. README.md updated with setup/run instructions. DELIVERY.md created.
- **Changes**: Updated README.md, created DELIVERY.md
- **Retries**: 0
- **Next**: DONE — deployed as self_host_individual (local binary + PostgreSQL)
